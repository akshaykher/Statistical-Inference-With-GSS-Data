#### Research question
There’s been a lot of discussion about the way morals and attitudes about sex are changing in this country. If a man and woman have sex relations before marriage, do you think it is:

* always wrong?
* almost always wrong?
* sometimes wrong?
* not wrong at all?

Now, how often do you attend religious events:

* Less than once a year?
* Once a year?
* Several times a year
* Once a month
* 2-3 times a month?
* Nearly every week
* Every week
* More than once a week

*A lot of research has been done on religion and sex separately. However, it would be interesting to explore any association between the two. So, does attending religious events have a relationship with opinion about pre-maritial sex? Let’s explore this question!*

The project consists of:

1. Data: Describes how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability / causality).
2. Research question: Came up with a research question that I wanted to answer.
3. EDA: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses the research question outlined above.
4. Inference: Performed inference that addresses the research question outlined above.
